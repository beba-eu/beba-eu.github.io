Our goal is to devise a data plane abstraction and prototype implementations for future-proof network devices capable of being repurposed with middlebox-type functions well beyond static packet forwarding, with a focus on stateful processing and packet generation.\r\n\r\nTo learn more visit the project home page [http://www.beba-project.eu/](http://www.beba-project.eu/).\r\n\r\n## Try BEBA with Mininet\r\n\r\nThe following commands have been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 (64 bit) with Mininet 2.2.1. You can download a Mininet VM at this link. For help running Mininet please refer to http://mininet.org/\r\n\r\nTo install both the [BEBA Software Switch](https://github.com/beba-eu/beba-switch) and the [BEBA Controller](https://github.com/beba-eu/beba-ctrl), type the following command in your shell:\r\n\r\n    bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://git.io/try-beba)\"\r\n\r\n### Example applications\r\n\r\nThis section is still work in progress...\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\nPlease submit your bug reports, fixes and suggestions as pull requests on\r\nGitHub, or by contacting us directly.\r\n",
